Ecocurious
----------

The **MultiGeiger** is a project of Ecocurious, your community for environment, nature and technology, see https://ecocurious.de/projekte/multigeiger/.

The goal is to establish a citizen measurement network for radioactivity in Germany.

The **MultiGeiger** hardware and software was designed by Jürgen Böhringer (http://www.boehri.de).

Reinhard/rexfue has further developed the software, the board, and is taking care of the integration of the sensors into our map https://ecocurious.de/multigeiger-karte/.

We have started the first workshops where you can assemble the components and the case with our support.

Workshop dates can be found here:
