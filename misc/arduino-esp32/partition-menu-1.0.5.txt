This patch adds back the partition scheme menu to the Arduino IDE
(tested with Arduino IDE 1.8.13).

With arduino-esp32 1.0.5 release, this menu somehow was dropped.

Problem: The default partitioning for the "Wireless Stick" HELTEC device
it uses now is "default_8MB" and only fits for 8MB flash size.

For MultiGeiger, this causes problems because we also need to flash
HELTEC "WiFi Kit 32" devices with 4MB flash size with the same release
binary and for that we need to be able to select the "Minimal SPIFFS"
(min_spiffs) partitioning scheme.

Applying the fix:

Locate the boards.txt, for me it was in there:

$ cd ~/.arduino15/packages/esp32/hardware/esp32/1.0.5

$ patch -p0 < partition-menu-1.0.5.diff

Restart the Arduino IDE.

In the IDE, select:
- Tools -> Board -> Heltec Wireless Stick
- Tools -> Partition Scheme -> Minimal SPIFFS
- Tools -> LoRaWan Region -> Region_EU868 (for Europe, 868MHz)

Now, flashing 4MB devices should work again.
